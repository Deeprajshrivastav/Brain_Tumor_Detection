# About Brain Tumor:
A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in the brain. Brain tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).
One of the tests to diagnose brain tumor is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A brain MRI images dataset founded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). You can find it here.
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains 253 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 155 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous (malignant) and the folder no contains 98 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous (benign).
Meaning that 61% (155 images) of the data are positive examples and 39% (98 images) are negative.
